# The Travis Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/travis)

The [travis gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/travis) includes both a [command line client](#command-line-client) and a [Ruby library](#ruby-library) to interface with a Travis CI service. Both work with [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org), [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) or any custom Travis CI setup you might have. Check out the [installation instructions](#installation) to get it running in no time.

## Command Line Client

There are three types of commands: [Non-API Commands](#non-api-commands), [General API Commands](#general-api-commands) and [Repository Commands](#repository-commands). All commands take the form of `travis COMMAND [ARGUMENTS] [OPTIONS]`. You can get a list of commands by running [`help`](#help).

### Non-API Commands

Every Travis command takes three global options:

    -h, --help                       Display help
    -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
    -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions

The `--help` option is equivalent to running `travis help COMMAND`.

The `--interactive` options determines wether to include additional information and colors in the output or not (except on Windows, we never display colors on Windows, sorry). If you don't set this option explicitly, you will run in interactive mode if you invoke the command directly in a shell and in non-interactive mode if you pipe it somewhere.

You probably want to use `--explode` if you are working on a patch for the Travis client, as it will give you the Ruby exception instead of a nice error message.

#### `help`

The `help` command will inform you about the arguments and options that the commands take, for instance:

    $ travis help help
    Usage: travis help [command] [options]
        -h, --help                       Display help
        -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
        -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions

Running `help` without a command name will give you a list of all available commands.

#### `version`

As you might have guessed, this command prints out the client's version.

### General API Commands

API commands inherit all options from [Non-API Commands](#non-api-commands).

Additionally, every API command understands the following options:

    -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
        --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
        --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
    -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use
        --debug                      show API requests
        --adapter ADAPTER            Faraday adapter to use for HTTP requests

By default, [General API Commands](#general-api-commands) will talk to [api.travis-ci.org](https://api.travis-ci.org). You can change this by supplying `--pro` for [api.travis-ci.com](https://api.travis-ci.com) or `--api-endpoint` with your own endpoint. Note that all [Repository Commands](#repository-commands) will try to figure out the API endpoint to talk to automatically depending on the project's visibility on GitHub.

You can supply an access token via `--token` if you want to make an authenticated call. If you don't have an access token stored for the API endpoint, it will remember it for subsequent requests. Keep in mind, this is not the "Travis token" used when setting up GitHub hooks (due to security). You probably don't have an access token handy right now. Don't worry, usually you won't use this option but instead just do a [`travis login`](#login).

The `--debug` option will print HTTP requests to STDERR. Like `--explode`, this is really helpful when contributing to this project.

There are many libraries out there to do HTTP requests in Ruby. You can switch amongst common ones with `--adapter`:

    $ travis show --adapter net-http
    ...
    $ gem install excon
    ...
    $ travis show --adapter excon
    ...

#### `console`

Running `travis console` gives you an interactive Ruby session with all the [entities](#entities) imported into global namespace.

But why use this over just `irb -r travis`? For one, it will take care of authentication, setting the correct endpoint, etc, and it also allows you to pass in `--debug` if you are curious as to what's actually going on.

    $ travis console
    >> User.current
    => #<User: rkh>
    >> Repository.find('sinatra/sinatra')
    => #<Repository: sinatra/sinatra>
    >> _.last_build
    => #<Travis::Client::Build: sinatra/sinatra#360>

#### `endpoint`

Just prints out the API endpoint you're talking to.

    $ travis endpoint
    API endpoint: https://api.travis-ci.org/

Handy for using it when working with shell scripts:

    $ curl "$(travis endpoint)/docs" > docs.html

#### `login`

The `login` command will, well, log you in. That way, all subsequent commands that run against the same endpoint will be authenticated.

    $ travis login
    We need your GitHub login to identify you.
    This information will not be sent to Travis CI, only to GitHub.
    The password will not be displayed.

    Try running with --github-token or --auto if you don't want to enter your password anyways.

    Username: rkh
    Password: *******************

    Successfully logged in!

As you can see above, it will ask you for your GitHub user name and password, but not send these to Travis CI. Instead, it will use them to create a GitHub API token, show the token to Travis, which then on its own checks if you really are who you say you are, and gives you an access token for the Travis API in return. The client will then delete the GitHub token again, just to be sure. But don't worry, all that happens under the hood and fully automatic.

If you don't want it to send your credentials to GitHub, you can create a GitHub token on your own and supply it via `--github-token`. In that case, the client will not delete the GitHub token (as it can't, it needs your password to do this). Travis CI will not store the token, though - after all, it already should have a valid token for you in the database.

A third option is for the really lazy: `--auto`. In this mode the client will try to find a GitHub token for you and just use that. This will only work if you have a [global GitHub token](https://help.github.com/articles/git-over-https-using-oauth-token) stored in your [.netrc](http://blogdown.io/c4d42f87-80dd-45d5-8927-4299cbdf261c/posts/574baa68-f663-4dcf-88b9-9d41310baf2f). If you haven't heard of this, it's worth looking into in general. Again: Travis CI will not store that token.

#### `raw`

This is really helpful both when working on this client and when exploring the [Travis API](https://api.travis-ci.org). It will simply fire a request against the API endpoint, parse the output and pretty print it. Keep in mind that the client takes care of authentication for you:

    $ travis raw /repos/travis-ci/travis
    {"repo"=>
      {"id"=>409371,
       "slug"=>"travis-ci/travis",
       "description"=>"Travis CI Client (CLI and Ruby library)",
       "last_build_id"=>4251410,
       "last_build_number"=>"77",
       "last_build_state"=>"passed",
       "last_build_duration"=>351,
       "last_build_language"=>nil,
       "last_build_started_at"=>"2013-01-19T18:00:49Z",
       "last_build_finished_at"=>"2013-01-19T18:02:17Z"}}

Use `--json` if you'd rather prefer the output to be JSON.

### `sync`

    Usage: travis sync [options]
        -h, --help                       Display help
        -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
        -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions
        -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
            --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
            --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
        -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use
            --debug                      show API requests
        -c, --check                      only check the sync status
        -b, --background                 will trigger sync but not block until sync is done
        -f, --force                      will force sync, even if one is already running

Sometimes the infos Travis CI has about users and repositories become out of date. If that should happen, you can manually trigger a sync:

    $ travis sync
    synchronizing: ........... done

The command blocks until the synchronization is done. You can avoid that with `--background`:

    $ travis sync --background
    starting synchronization

If you just want to know if your account is being synchronized right now, use `--check`:

    $ travis sync --check
    rkh is currently syncing

#### `token`

In order to use the Ruby library you will need to obtain an access token first. To do this simply run the `travis login` command. Once logged in you can check your token with `travis token`:

    $ travis token
    Your access token is super-secret

You can use that token for instance with curl:

    $ curl -H "Authorization: token $(travis token)" https://api.travis-ci.org/users/
    {"login":"rkh","name":"Konstantin Haase","email":"konstantin.haase@gmail.com","gravatar_id":"5c2b452f6eea4a6d84c105ebd971d2a4","locale":"en","is_syncing":false,"synced_at":"2013-01-21T20:31:06Z"}

Note that if you just need it for looking at API payloads, that we also have the [`raw`](#raw) command.

#### `whatsup`

It's just a tiny feature, but it allows you to take a look at repositories that have recently seen some action (ie the left hand sidebar on [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org)):

    $ travis whatsup
    mysociety/fixmystreet started: #154
    eloquent/typhoon started: #228
    Pajk/apipie-rails started: #84
    qcubed/framework failed: #21
    ...

If you only want to see what happened in your repositories, add the `--my-repos` flag (short: `-m`):

    $ travis whatsup -m
    travis-ci/travis passed: #169
    rkh/dpl passed: #50
    rubinius/rubinius passed: #3235
    sinatra/sinatra errored: #619
    rtomayko/tilt failed: #162
    ruby-no-kai/rubykaigi2013 passed: #50
    rack/rack passed: #519
    ...

#### `whoami`

This command is useful to verify that you're in fact logged in:

    $ travis whoami
    You are rkh (Konstantin Haase)

Again, like most other commands, goes well with shell scripting:

    $ git clone "https://github.com/$(travis whoami)/some_project"

### Repository Commands

    -h, --help                       Display help
    -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
    -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions
    -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
        --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
        --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
    -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use
        --debug                      show API requests
    -r, --repo SLUG

Repository commands have all the options [General API Commands](#general-api-commands) have.

Additionally, you can specify the Repository to talk to by providing `--repo owner/name`. However, if you invoke the command inside a clone of the project, the client will figure out this option on its own. Note that it uses the tracked [git remote](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote.html) for the current branch (and defaults to 'origin' if no tracking is set) to do so.

It will also automatically pick [Travis Pro](https://travis-ci.com) if it is a private project. You can of course override this decission with `--pro`, `--org` or `--api-endpoint URL`

#### `branches`

Displays the most recent build for each branch:

    $ travis branches
    hh-add-warning-old-style:                  #35   passed     Add a warning if old-style encrypt is being used
    hh-multiline-encrypt:                      #55   passed     Merge branch 'master' into hh-multiline-encrypt
    rkh-show-logs-history:                     #72   passed     regenerate gemspec
    rkh-debug:                                 #75   passed     what?
    hh-add-clear-cache-to-global-session:      #135  passed     Add clear_cache(!) to Travis::Namespace
    hh-annotations:                            #146  passed     Initial annotation support
    hh-remove-newlines-from-encrypted-string:  #148  errored    Remove all whitespace from an encrypted string
    version-check:                             #157  passed     check travis version for updates from time to time
    master:                                    #163  passed     add Repository#branches and Repository#branch(name)

For more fine grained control and older builds on a specific branch, see [`history`](#history).

#### `disable`

If you want to turn of a repository temporarily or indefinitely, you can do so with the `disable` command:

    $ travis disable
    travis-ci/travis: disabled :(

#### `enable`

With the `enable` command, you can easily activate a project on Travis CI:

    $ travis enable
    travis-ci/travis: enabled :)

It even works when enabling a repo Travis didn't know existed by triggering a sync:

    $ travis enable -r rkh/test
    repository not known to Travis CI (or no access?)
    triggering sync: ............. done
    rkh/test: enabled

If you don't want the sync to be triggered, use `--skip-sync`.

#### `encrypt`

    Usage: bin/travis encrypt [args..] [options]
        -h, --help                       Display help
        -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
        -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions
            --skip-version-check         don't check if travis client is up to date
        -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
            --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
            --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
            --staging                    talks to staging system
        -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use
            --debug                      show API requests
            --adapter ADAPTER            Faraday adapter to use for HTTP requests
        -r, --repo SLUG                  repository to use (will try to detect from current git clone)
        -a, --add [KEY]                  adds it to .travis.yml under KEY (default: env.global)
        -s, --[no-]split                 treat each line as a separate input
        -p, --append                     don't override existing values, instead treat as list
        -x, --override                   override existing value

This command is useful to encrypt [environment variables](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/encryption-keys/) or deploy keys for private dependencies.

    $ travis encrypt FOO=bar
    Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:

      secure: "gSly+Kvzd5uSul15CVaEV91ALwsGSU7yJLHSK0vk+oqjmLm0jp05iiKfs08j\n/Wo0DG8l4O9WT0mCEnMoMBwX4GiK4mUmGdKt0R2/2IAea+M44kBoKsiRM7R3\n+62xEl0q9Wzt8Aw3GCDY4XnoCyirO49DpCH6a9JEAfILY/n6qF8="

    Pro Tip™: You can add it automatically by running with --add.

For deploy keys, it is really handy to pipe them into the command:

    $ cat id_rsa | travis encrypt

Another use case for piping files into it: If you have a file with sensitive environment variables, like foreman's [.env](http://ddollar.github.com/foreman/#ENVIRONMENT) file, you can add tell the client to encrypt every line separately via `--split`:

    $ cat .env | travis encrypt --split
    Please add the following to your .travis.yml file:

      secure: "KmMdcwTWGubXVRu93/lY1NtyHxrjHK4TzCfemgwjsYzPcZuPmEA+pz+umQBN\n1ZhzUHZwDNsDd2VnBgYq27ZdcS2cRvtyI/IFuM/xJoRi0jpdTn/KsXR47zeE\nr2bFxRqrdY0fERVHSMkBiBrN/KV5T70js4Y6FydsWaQgXCg+WEU="
      secure: "jAglFtDjncy4E3upL/RF0ZOcmJ2UMrqHFCLQwU8PBdurhTMBeTw+IO6cXx5z\nU5zqvPYo/ghZ8mMuUhvHiGDM6m6OlMP7+l10VTxH1CoVew2NcQvRdfK3P+4S\nZJ43Hyh/ZLCjft+JK0tBwoa3VbH2+ZTzkRZQjdg54bE16C7Mf1A="

    Pro Tip™: You can add it automatically by running with --add.

As suggested, the client can also add them to your `.travis.yml` for you:

    $ travis encrypt FOO=bar --add

This will by default add it as global variables for every job. You can also add it as matrix entries by providing a key:

    $ travis encrypt FOO=bar --add env.matrix

There are two ways the client can treat existing values:

* Turn existing value into a list if it isn't already, append new value to that list. This is the default behavior for keys that start with `env.` and can be enforced with `--append`.
* Replace existing value. This is the default behavior for keys that do not start with `env.` and can be enforced with `--override`.

#### `history`

    Usage: travis history [options]
        -h, --help                       Display help
        -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
        -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions
        -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
            --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
            --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
        -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use
            --debug                      show API requests
        -r, --repo SLUG
        -a, --after BUILD                Only show history after a given build number
        -p, --pull-request NUMBER        Only show history for the given Pull Request
        -b, --branch BRANCH              Only show history for the given branch
        -l, --limit LIMIT                Maximum number of history items
            --[no-]all                   Display all history items

You can check out what the recent builds look like:

    $ travis history
    #77 passed:   master fix name clash
    #76 failed:   master Merge pull request #11 from travis-ci/rkh-show-logs-history
    #75 passed:   rkh-debug what?
    #74 passed:   rkh-debug all tests pass locally and on the travis vm I spin up :(
    #73 failed:   Pull Request #11 regenerate gemspec
    #72 passed:   rkh-show-logs-history regenerate gemspec
    #71 failed:   Pull Request #11 spec fix for (older) rubinius
    #70 passed:   rkh-show-logs-history spec fix for (older) rubinius
    #69 failed:   Pull Request #11 strange fix for rubinius
    #68 failed:   rkh-show-logs-history strange fix for rubinius

By default, it will display the last 10 builds. You can limit (or extend) the number of builds with `--limit`:

    $ travis history --limit 2
    #77 passed:   master fix name clash
    #76 failed:   master Merge pull request #11 from travis-ci/rkh-show-logs-history

You can use `--after` to display builds after a certain build number (or, well, before, but it's called after to use the same phrases as the API):

    $ travis history --limit 2 --after 76
    #75 passed:   rkh-debug what?
    #74 passed:   rkh-debug all tests pass locally and on the travis vm I spin up :(

You can also limit the history to builds for a certain branch:

    $ travis history --limit 3 --branch master
    #77 passed:   master fix name clash
    #76 failed:   master Merge pull request #11 from travis-ci/rkh-show-logs-history
    #57 passed:   master Merge pull request #5 from travis-ci/hh-multiline-encrypt

#### `init`

    Usage: travis init [language] [file] [options]
        -h, --help                       Display help
        -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
        -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions
            --skip-version-check         don't check if travis client is up to date
        -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
            --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
            --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
            --staging                    talks to staging system
        -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use
            --debug                      show API requests
            --adapter ADAPTER            Faraday adapter to use for HTTP requests
        -r, --repo SLUG                  repository to use (will try to detect from current git clone)
        -s, --skip-sync                  don't trigger a sync if the repo is unknown
        -f, --force                      override .travis.yml if it already exists
        -k, --skip-enable                do not enable project, only add .travis.yml

When setting up a new project, you can run `travis init` to generate a `.travis.yml` and [enable](#enable) the project:

    $ travis init java
    .travis.yml file created!
    travis-ci/java-example: enabled :)

#### `logs`

Given a job number, logs simply prints out that job's logs.

    $ travis logs 77.1
    [... more logs ...]
    Your bundle is complete! Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
    $ bundle exec rake
    /home/travis/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-p371/bin/ruby -S rspec spec -c
    Faraday: you may want to install system_timer for reliable timeouts
    ...................................................................................................................................................................

    Finished in 6.48 seconds
    163 examples, 0 failures

    Done. Build script exited with: 0

#### `open`

Opens the project view in the Travis CI web interface. If you pass it a build or job number, it will open that specific view:

    $ travis open

If you just want the URL printed out instead of opened in a browser, pass `--print`.

If instead you want to open the repository, compare or pull request view on GitHub, use `--github`.

    $ travis open 56 --print --github
    web view: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis/pull/5

#### `pubkey`

Outputs the public key for a repository.

    $ travis pubkey
    Public key for travis-ci/travis:
    
    ssh-rsa ...
    $ travis pubkey -r rails/rails > rails.key

The `--pem` flag will print out the key PEM encoded:

    $ travis pubkey --pem
    Public key for travis-ci/travis:

    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    ...
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

#### `restart`

This command will restart the latest build:

    $ travis restart
    build #85 has been restarted

You can also restart any build by giving a build number:

    $ travis restart 57
    build #57 has been restarted

Or a single job:

    $ travis restart 57.1
    job #57.1 has been restarted

#### `setup`

Helps you configure Travis addons.

    Usage: bin/travis setup service [options]
        -h, --help                       Display help
        -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
        -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions
            --skip-version-check         don't check if travis client is up to date
        -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
            --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
            --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
            --staging                    talks to staging system
        -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use
            --debug                      show API requests
            --adapter ADAPTER            Faraday adapter to use for HTTP requests
        -r, --repo SLUG                  repository to use (will try to detect from current git clone)
        -f, --force                      override config section if it already exists

Available services: `heroku`, `nodejitsu`, `openshift` and `sauce_connect`.

Example:

    $ travis setup heroku
    Deploy only from travis-ci/travis-chat? |yes|
    Encrypt API key? |yes|

#### `status`

    Usage: travis status [options]
        -h, --help                       Display help
        -i, --[no-]interactive           be interactive and colorful
        -E, --[no-]explode               don't rescue exceptions
        -e, --api-endpoint URL           Travis API server to talk to
            --pro                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.com/'
            --org                        short-cut for --api-endpoint 'https://api.travis-ci.org/'
        -t, --token [ACCESS_TOKEN]       access token to use

        -r, --repo SLUG
        -x, --[no-]exit-code             sets the exit code to 1 if the build failed
        -q, --[no-]quiet                 does not print anything
        -p, --[no-]fail-pending          sets the status code to 1 if the build is pending

Outputs a one line status message about the project's last build. With `-q` that line will even not be printed out. How's that useful? Combine it with `-x` and the exit code will be 1 if the build failed, with `-p` and it will be 1 for a pending build.

    $ travis status -qpx && cap deploy

## Ruby Library

There are two approaches of using the Ruby library, one straight forward with one global session:

``` ruby
require 'travis'

rails = Travis::Repository.find('rails/rails')
puts "oh no" unless rails.green?
```

And one where you have to instantiate your own session:

``` ruby
require 'travis/client'

client = Travis::Client.new
rails  = client.repo('rails/rails')
puts "oh no" unless rails.green?
```

For most parts, those are pretty much the same, the entities you get back look the same, etc, except one offers nice constants as part of the API, the other doesn't. In fact the "global" session style uses `Travis::Client` internally.

So, which one to choose? The global style has one session, whereas with the client style, you have one session per client instance. Each session has it's own cache and identity map. This might matter for log running processes. If you use a new session for separate units of work, you can be pretty sure to not leak any objects. On the other hand using the constants or reusing the same session might save you from unnecessary HTTP requests.

In either way, if you should use the first approach or long living clients, here is how you make sure not to have stale data around:

``` ruby
Travis.clear_cache
client.clear_cache
```

Note that this will still keep the identity map around, it will only drop all attributes. To clear the identity map, you can use the `clear_cache!` method. However, if you do that, you should not keep old instances of any entities (like repositories, etc) around.

### Authentication

Authentication is pretty easy, you just need to set an access token:

``` ruby
require 'travis'

Travis.access_token = "..."
puts "Hello #{Travis::User.current.name}!"
```

Or with your own client instance:

``` ruby
require 'travis/client'

client = Travis::Client.new
puts "Hello #{client.user.name}"
```

See [the token command](#token) for obtaining the access token used by the CLI.

If you don't have an access token for Travis CI, you can use a GitHub access token to get one:

``` ruby
require 'travis'

Travis.github_auth("...")
puts "Hello #{Travis::User.current.name}!"
```

Travis CI will not store that token.

### Using Pro

Using the library with private projects pretty much works the same, except you use `Travis::Pro`.

Keep in mind that you need to authenticate.

``` ruby
require 'travis/pro'

Travis::Pro.access_token = '...'
user = Travis::Pro::User.current

puts "Hello #{user.name}!"
```

### Entities

Entities are like the models in the Travis Client land. They keep the data and it's usually them you talk to if you want something.
They are pretty much normal Ruby objects.

The Travis session will cache all entities, so don't worry about loading the same one twice.
Once you got a hold of one, you can easily reload it at any time if you want to make sure the data is fresh:

``` ruby
rails = Travis::Repository.find('rails/rails')
sleep 1.hour
rails.reload
```

The travis gem supports lazy and partial loading, so if you want to make sure you have all the data, just call load.

``` ruby
rails.load
```

This is not something you should usually do, as partial loading is actually your friend (keeps requests to a minimum).


#### Stateful Entities

[Repositories](#repositories), [Builds](#builds) and [Jobs](#jobs) all are basically state machines, which means the implement the following methods:

``` ruby
require 'travis'
build = Travis::Repository.find('rails/rails').last_build

p build.canceled?
p build.created?
p build.errored?
p build.failed?
p build.finished?
p build.green?
p build.passed?
p build.pending?
p build.queued?
p build.red?
p build.running?
p build.started?
p build.successful?
p build.unsuccessful?
p build.yellow?
p build.color
```

Builds and jobs also have a `state` method. For repositories, use `last_build.state`.

#### Repositories

Repositories are probably one of the first entities you'll load. It's pretty straight forward, too.

``` ruby
require 'travis'

Travis::Repository.find('rails/rails')            # find by slug
Travis::Repository.find(891)                      # find by id
Travis::Repository.find_all(owner_name: 'rails')  # all repos in the rails organization
Travis::Repository.current                        # repos that see some action right now
```

Once you have a repository, you can for instance encrypt some strings with its private key:

``` ruby
require 'travis'

Travis::Repository.find('rails/rails')
puts repo.encrypt('FOO=bar')
```

Repositories are [stateful](#stateful-entities).

You can enable or disable a repository with the methods that go by the same name.

``` ruby
rails.disable
system "push all the things"
rails.enable
```

If you want to enable a new project, you might have to do a sync first.

#### Builds

You could load a build by its id using `Travis::Build.find`. But most of the time you won't have the id handy, so you'd usually start with a repository.

``` ruby
require 'travis'
rails = Travis::Repository.find('rails/rails')

rails.last_build               # the latest build
rails.recent_builds            # the last 20 or so builds (don't rely on that number)
rails.builds(after_number: 42) # the last 20 or so builds *before* 42
rails.build(42)                # build with the number 42 (not the id!)
rails.builds                   # Enumerator for #each_build

# this will loop through all builds
rails.each_build do |build|
  puts "#{build.number}: #{build.state}"
end

# this will loop through all builds before build 42
rails.each_build(after_number: 42) do |build|
  puts "#{build.number}: #{build.state}"
end
```

Note that `each_build` (and thus `builds` without and argument) is lazy and uses pagination, so you can safely do things like this:

``` ruby
build = rails.builds.detect { |b| b.failed? }
puts "Last failing Rails build: #{build.number}"
```

Without having to load more than 6000 builds.

You can restart a build, if the current user has sufficient permissions on the repository:

``` ruby
rails.last_build.restart
```

You can also retrieve a Hash mapping branch names to the latest build on that given branch via `branches` or use the `branch` method to get the last build for a specific branch:

``` ruby
if rails.branch('4-0-stable').green?
  puts "Time for another 4.0.x release!"
end

count = rails.branches.size
puts "#{count} rails branches tested on travis"
```

#### Jobs

Jobs behave a lot like [builds](#builds), and similar to them, you probably don't have the id ready. You can get the jobs from a build:

``` ruby
rails.last_build.jobs.each do |job|
  puts "#{job.number} took #{job.duration} seconds"
end
```

If you have the job number, you can also reach a job directly from the repository:

``` ruby
rails.job('5000.1')
```

Like builds, you can also restart singe jobs:

``` ruby
rails.job('5000.1').restart
```

#### Artifacts

The artifacts you usually care for are probably logs. You can reach them directly from a build:

``` ruby
require 'travis'

repo = Travis::Repository.find('travis-ci/travis')
job  = repo.last_build.jobs.first
puts job.log.body
```

If you plan to print our the body, be aware that it might contain malicious escape codes. For this reason, we added `colorized_body`, which removes all the unprintable characters, except for ANSI color codes, and `clean_body` which also removes the color codes.

``` ruby
puts job.log.colorized_body
````

#### Users

The only user you usually get access to is the currently authenticated one.

``` ruby
require 'travis'

Travis.access_token = '...'
user = Travis::User.current

puts "Hello, #{user.login}! Or should I call you... #{user.name.upcase}!?"
```

If some data gets out of sync between GitHub and Travis, you can use the user object to trigger a new sync.

``` ruby
Travis::User.current.sync
```

#### Commits

Commits cannot be loaded directly. They come as a byproduct of [jobs](#jobs) and [builds](#builds).

``` ruby
require 'travis'

repo   = Travis::Repository.find('travis-ci/travis')
commit = repo.last_build.commit

puts "Last tested commit: #{commit.short_sha} on #{commit.branch} by #{commit.author_name} - #{commit.subject}"
```

#### Workers

If a worker is running something, it will reference a `job` and a `repository`. Otherwise the values will be `nil`.

``` ruby
require 'travis'
workers = Travis::Worker.find_all

workers.each do |worker|
  puts "#{worker.name}: #{worker.host} - #{worker.state} - #{worker.repository.slug if worker.repository}"
end
```

### Dealing with Sessions

Under the hood the session is where the fun is happening. Most methods on the constants and entities just wrap methods on your session, so you don't have to pass the session around all the time or even see it if you don't want to.

There are two levels of session methods, the higher level methods from the `Travis::Client::Methods` mixin, which are also available from `Travis`, `Travis::Pro` or any custom [Namespace](#using-namespaces).

``` ruby
require 'travis/client/session'
session = Travis::Client::Session.new

session.access_token = "secret_token"           # access token to use
session.api_endpoint = "http://localhost:3000/" # api endpoint to talk to
session.github_auth("github_token")             # log in with a github token
session.repos(owner_name: 'travis-ci')          # all travis-ci/* projects
session.repo('travis-ci/travis')                # this project
session.repo(409371)                            # same as the one above
session.build(4266036)                          # build with id 4266036
session.job(4266037)                            # job with id 4266037
session.artifact(42)                            # artifact with id 42
session.log(42)                                 # same as above
session.user                                    # the current user, if logged in
session.restart(session.build(4266036))         # restart some build
```

You can add these methods to any object responding to `session` via said mixin.

Below this, there is a second API, close to the HTTP level:

``` ruby
require 'travis/client/session'
session = Travis::Client::Session.new

session.instrument do |description, block|
  time = Time.now
  block.call
  puts "#{description} took #{Time.now - time} seconds"
end

session.connection = Faraday::Connection.new

session.get_raw('/repos/rails/rails') # => {"repo" => {"id" => 891, "slug" => "rails/rails", ...}}
session.get('/repos/rails/rails')     # => {"repo" => #<Travis::Client::Repository: rails/rails>}
session.headers['Foo'] = 'Bar'        # send a custom HTTP header with every request

rails = session.find_one(Travis::Client::Repository, 'rails/rails')

session.find_many(Travis::Client::Repository)  # repositories with the latest builds
session.find_one_or_many(Travis::Client::User) # the current user (you could also use find_one here)

session.reload(rails)
session.reset(rails)  # lazy reload

session.clear_cache   # empty cached attributes
session.clear_cache!  # empty identity map
```

### Using Namespaces

`Travis` and `Travis::Pro` are just two different namespaces for two different Travis sessions. A namespace is a Module, exposing the higher level [session methods](#dealing-with-sessions). It also has a dummy constant for every [entity](#entities), wrapping `find_one` (aliased to `find`) and `find_many` (aliased to `find_all`) for you, so you don't have to keep track of the session or hand in the entity class. You can easily create your own namespace:

``` ruby
require 'travis/client'
MyTravis = Travis::Client::Namespaces.new("http://localhost:3000")

MyTravis.access_token = "..."
MyTravis::Repository.find("foo/bar")
```

Since namespaces are Modules, you can also include them.

``` ruby
require 'travis/client'

class MyTravis
  include Travis::Client::Namespaces.new
end

MyTravis::Repository.find('rails/rails')
```

## Installation

Make sure you have at least [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) 1.9.3 (2.0.0 recommended) installed.

You can check your Ruby version by running `ruby -v`:

    $ ruby -v
    ruby 2.0.0p195 (2013-05-14 revision 40734) [x86_64-darwin12.3.0]

Then run:

    $ gem install travis -v 1.3.1 --no-rdoc --no-ri

Now make sure everything is working:

    $ travis verision
    1.3.1

### Updating your Ruby

If you have an outdated Ruby version, you should use your package system or a Ruby Installer to install a recent Ruby.

#### Mac OSX via Homebrew

Mac OSX prior to 10.9 ships with a very dated Ruby version. You can use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) to install a recent version:

    $ brew install ruby
    $ gem update --system

#### Windows

On Windows, we recommend using the [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/), which includes the latest version of Ruby.

#### Other Unix systems

On other Unix systems, like Linux, use your package system to install Ruby. Please inquire before hand which package you might actually want to install, as for some distributions `ruby` might actually still be 1.8.7 or older.

Ubuntu and Debian:

    $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3 ruby-switch
    $ sudo ruby-switch --set ruby1.9.3

Fedora Core:

    $ sudo yum install ruby

Arch Linux:

    $ sudo pacman -S ruby


#### Ruby versioning tools

Alternatively, you can use a Ruby version management tool such as [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/), [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/) or [https://github.com/postmodern/chruby](chruby). This is only recommended if you need to run multiple versions of Ruby.

You can of course always compile Ruby from source, though then you are left with the hassle of keeping it up to date and making sure that everything is set up properly.

### Upgrading from travis-cli

If you have the old `travis-cli` gem installed, you should `gem uninstall travis-cli`, just to be sure, as it ships with an executable that is also named `travis`.
